# Checking over your deliverables for [lab01]({{'/lab/lab01/' | relative_url }}) 

The following deliverables are due for [lab01]({{'/lab/lab01/' | relative_url }}) .   Check over them and make sure these are complete.

Also look at the green "Graded" boxes in the instructions for [lab01]({{'/lab/lab01/' | relative_url }}) 

* There should be a Kanban board (a Github Project associated with your repo) for your team
   (Check that the 
* That Kanban board should have a complete set of user stories on it, that, when complete, results in a minium viable product for
   your app; one that clearly delivers value to the user.  
* There should be a complete set of issues for each of those user stories; a set of issue that are specific TODO's that a individual, pair, or 
   sub-group of your project team can pick up and start coding from.  Each of those issues should have a clear set of criteria for
   what it means to be "done" with that issue.
* In addition, there should be set of issues for creating "Hello World" apps;  There should be one per each team member or pair of team
   members, and each team member or pair should be *assigned* to that issue on the Kanban board.


# Deliverables for lab02

By the due date of this assignment (i.e. {{ page.due }} ), you should have completed your first project increment.   

That increment includes all of the following:
* Each team member has participated either as a solo programmer, or as part of a pair, in producing a "Hello World" type app for the
   framework you are using for your project.   You will get two grades for this: one as part of your team grade, and another as
   an individual grade, as explained below.
   
# What *each* "Hello World" branch/pull-request must contain for full credit.
   
* Each individual or pair should have built a hello world app suitable for your framework.
* You should have instructions in your read me on what software must be installed in order to deploy your app. 
   A TA, Mentor, or another class member should be able to follow these instructions and successfully deploy your app.
* 

# *Each* webapp "Hello, World" branch/pull-request should be deployed

If your app is being deployed as a webapp: you should have have DEPLOYED it so that it runs on a service such as Heroku, 
Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services, etc. at a stable URL.    The easist platform on which to do this
for Java Spring Boot, and Python Flask is Heroku.   If you don't know how, ask on the slack channel (well in advance, not at the last minute), 
and mentors and other students can point you to the resources to get started with this.

Put the URL of your running app in the README in your branch.

# *Each* non-webapp "Hello, World" branch/pull-request should be demoed

If you are NOT doing a webapp, you must set up a time with your mentor, or your TA, to demo your app to them.  You are strongly encouraged to do 
this BEFORE the lab next Thursday.   The mentors and TAs hold 
[open lab hours]({{'/info/open_lab_hours/' | relative_url }}) during which you can schedule this demo.    The last opportunity to do this demo
is during lab on the due date for this assignment, but it may not be possible to fit all of those in.   Please coordinate with your team to
get as many of these demos done *before* lab on the due date of this assignment.

If working in a pair, *each* member of the pair should demo the app, to show that they understand how to run it.



<div class="grade" markdown="1">

**Graded**: (20 pts) You earn these points if/when you:
* met the criteria for the previous item (present in lab, team forked repo, you are a collaborator), AND
* your team has created a Kanban board by the due date of the lab, ({{page.due |  date: "%a, %b %d at %l:%M%p"}})
