# These instructions are for mentors/TAs only

Students, you are welcome to read them; there are no secrets here.   But there are probably better uses of your time. :-)

# NOTE: Instructions for setting up the feedback repos were moved to lab00_mentors.md where they should be in future iterations of the course.
