# These instructions are for mentors/TAs only

Students, you are welcome to read them; there are no secrets here.   But there are probably better uses of your time. :-)

# First priority: read the regular [lab03]({{ '/lab/lab03/' | relative_url }}); help your team

Nothing in these instructions is more urgent that helping the team that you are physically present with.

Only do these things tonight as/when time permits.  You can totally do all of this later.

But if the team is chugging along fine, please try to get this side-work done; the sooner it is done, the sooner we 
can start getting the teams some feedback on their work so far.

# Create a team level FEEDBACK repo

First thing: go to <https://github.com/ucsb-cs48-w19> and create a new **private* repo with your teams name followed by the suffix `_FEEDBACK`

| For team | create repo |
|----------|-------------|
| `4pm-stock-trading` | `4pm-stock-trading_FEEDBACK` |
| `5pm-pet-life` | `5pm-pet-life_FEEDBACK` |

etc...

Create it as follows:
* private
* with a `README.md`
* no `.gitignore` and no `LICENSE`  needed

Then, add each of the team members to that repo as collaborators, by their github id, with READ ONLY permission.
