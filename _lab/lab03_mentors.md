# These instructions are for mentors/TAs only

Students, you are welcome to read them; there are no secrets here.   But there are probably better uses of your time. :-)

# First priority: read the regular [lab03]({{ '/lab/lab03/' | relative_url }}); help your team

Nothing in these instructions is more urgent that helping the team that you are physically present with.

Only do these things tonight as/when time permits.  You can totally do all of this later.

But if the team is chugging along fine, please try to get this side-work done; the sooner it is done, the sooner we 
can start getting the teams some feedback on their work so far.

The task is to create feedback repos for the individual students.  These are the places where we'll record information
about their grades for various items in the course.

(Note that it would be *so much nicer* if we had an app to do this.    I would love to help mentor a team of programmers to do just that, and had thought we'd be doing that this quarter.   Instead, I'm spending my time fighting cancer.  Next quarter, perhaps.  So in the meantime, we'll just continue to do it by hand, and it'll get done fast since we are spreading the work over 10 mentors.)

# Create a team level FEEDBACK repo for each of your teams

First thing: go to <https://github.com/ucsb-cs48-w19> and create a new **private* repo with your teams name followed by the suffix `_FEEDBACK`

| For team | create repo |
|----------|-------------|
| `4pm-stock-trading` | `4pm-stock-trading_FEEDBACK` |
| `5pm-pet-life` | `5pm-pet-life_FEEDBACK` |

etc...

Create it as follows:
* private
* with a `README.md`
* no `.gitignore` and no `LICENSE`  needed

Then, add each of the team members to that repo as collaborators, by their github id, with READ ONLY permission.


# Create individual team member FEEDBACK repos

Now, for each team member, on each of your teams:

Create a new **private* repo with the prefix of the team name, then `_FEEDBACK` then `_` then the individual's github id.

For example, 

| For team | with member with github id | create repo |
|----------|----------------------------|--------------|
| `5pm-pet-life` | `cgaucho78`  | `5pm-pet-life_FEEDBACK_cgaucho78` |
| `5pm-pet-life` | `bondjamesbond`  | `5pm-pet-life_FEEDBACK_bondjamesbond` |
| `5pm-pet-life` | `haskellkween`  | `5pm-pet-life_FEEDBACK_haskellkween` |

etc...

Create it as follows:
* private
* with a `README.md`
* no `.gitignore` and no `LICENSE`  needed

Then, for each of these, only that individual student  as collaborators, by their github id, with READ ONLY permission.

You'll get more instructions later on what to put in those feedback repos as the mentors start reviewing the work of the teams on lab00, lab01, lab02 and lab03, and then the TAs and the instructor begin to assign grades for it.
