STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS--DO NOT START THIS LAB YET.

WE MIGHT CHANGE IT COMPLETELY BEFORE FRIDAY.

If you find typos or problems with the lab instructions, please report
them on Piazza

## Step 0: Find your assigned seat and locate your mentor

Seating charts are here:

* [4pm seating chart]({{ '/info/4pm_seating_chart/' | relative_url}}
* [5pm seating chart]({{ '/info/5pm_seating_chart/' | relative_url}}
* [6pm seating chart]({{ '/info/6pm_seating_chart/' | relative_url}}


## Step 1: Create a CoE account if you don't have one already

We encourage you to complete all programming assignments by logging in
to the machines in the Computer Science labs, or to connect
remotely. To do this you will need a **College of Engineering
account**. You can create an account online at
<https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create>.

If you are enrolled in <i>any</i> CoE course this quarter (including CS48), you
should be able to create your account immediately.

If you are not able to do so, you will need to contact the ECI Help Desk at <a href="mailto:help@engineering.ucsb.edu">help@engineering.ucsb.edu</a>.

## Step 2: Get setup with github and add yourself to our organization

We will be using github.com in this course. We have created an
organization called {{site.github_org}} on github.com where you can
create repositories (repos) for your assignments in this course.

The advantage of creating private repos under this organization is
that the course staff (your instructors and TAs) will be able to see
your code and provide you with help, without you having to do anything
special.

To join this organization, you need to do three things.

1. If you don't already have a github.com account, create one on the
"free" plan. Visit [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

2. If you don't already have your @umail.ucsb.edu email address
associated with your github.com account. go to "settings", add that
email, and confirm that email address.

3. Visit our Github Sign Up Tool at <{{page.signup_app}}>.   Navigate to <{{page.signup_app}}>.  Login with your github.com account. Click "Home", find this course ({{site.course}}, {{site.qtr}}), and click the "Join course button".   That will automatically send you an invitation to join the course organization on github.

4. There should be a link to the invitation for the GitHub organization for this course (<https://github.com/{{site.github_org}}>). Click on the invitation link and accept it. You can also go straight to <https://github.com/{{site.github_org}}> and see the invitation there (if you're logged in). Accept the invitation that appears in your browser (from step 3) or log into your account on [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) to accept the invitation.

## Step 3: Slack channel for your team

Find your mentor.  The team list is here, and it will tell you who your mentor is:

* [/info/team_list]({{ '/info/team_list/' | relative_url }})
