# Instructions TBD

Instructions for the demoing and presentation of the MVP to your mentor and TA during lab on {{page.due}} will appear here soon.

# Instructors for Reviewers

As the reviewer, you are from team A, and reviewing the work of team B.

Present, there should be:
* You, lead reviewer from team A
* Someone from team A to take notes on the Slack
* Lead reviewee from team B
* Someone from team B to take notes on the Slack
* The mentor for team B.

1.  Start by making sure that you and your helper from team A are added to the slack for team B.

2.  Then, start by sitting at the lead reviewee from team B's computer, where lead reviewee from team B has the product up and running.

3.  Ask the lead reviewee to walk you through the features of the product, as YOU, leader reviewer from team A, control the mouse and keyboard.    You, the lead reviewer should be going through the features of the product, led by an explanation of the reviewee from team B.  

    As you notice things you like, and things that could be improved, say them out loud.  Both the person from team A and the person from team B should be noting these things on the Slack.    The person from Team A should simply make notes about your observations.  The person from team B may go a step further, and note what the team might do in response (e.g. add issues, add user stories, add bug fixes, etc.)
    
4.  When you have gone through the product demo, now go to your OWN computer.   Pull up the Kanban board.

    Go through all of the user stories and issues that you see that are marked as part of MVP in in-progress or done. 
    
    Comment on whatever you see that either in-line with what you experienced in the demo, out out of alignment, in your view as a potential user of the product.  Again, the notetakers should make notes as they did in earlier steps.
    
5.  Now, pull up the README.md for the project in the repo.

    Go through it and make sure it doesn't have any "TODO" items in it.  If it does, comment on those, and note that they should perhaps be addressed.  
    
    Finally, on your OWN computer, try to clone the repo, and follow the steps needed to get the application up and running.
    
    You should NOT need any credentials from the original team---if there is a database setup needed, you should BE ABLE TO DO THAT DATABASE SET UP YOURSELF by following the instructions in the README.md.  If that is not possible, then note this as one of the observations.    At any point that you are stuck and cannot continue, as a last resort, the reviewee can jump in and help, by guiding you through the process, but NOT by providing you database credentials or API credentials--only by walking you through the process of setting up your own.
