# Adjourning your Team / Final Retro

You may wonder what the purpose of a retro is if/when your team is "adjourning" (the final stage in [Tuckman's forming/norming/storming/performing/adjourning model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)).

After all, you've been told that a retro's purpose is to help a team improve, and if a team is not going to be working together any more, why pay attention to helping the team improve?

Clearly, this team retro / adjourning ceremony must be serving a different purpose and may need to have a different form.

We'll discuss this in the days leading up to {{page.num}}.

# Instructions TBD

Instructions for:
* {{page.due}} and 
* what you need to complete by  {{page.due | date: "%a, %b %d at %l:%M%p"}} 
will appear here soon.
