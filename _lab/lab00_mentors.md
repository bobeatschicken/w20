# These instructions are for mentors/TAs only

Students, you are welcome to read them; there are no secrets here.   But there are probably better uses of your time. :-)

# Mentor Review of lab00

Due {{page.mentor_due}}

The evaluation of lab00 is entirely at the team level, and will be completed in a file called `lab00.md` in the team `_FEEDBACK` repos.  

The repo <https://github.com/{{page.github_org}}/FEEDBACK_TEMPLATES> contains templates for feedback for various assignemnts that we'll
give throughout the quarter.  In that repo, locate the file:

* <https://github.com/{{page.github_org}}/FEEDBACK_TEMPLATES/lab00.md>

You can copy the contents of that file into each of your feedback repos, and then fill in the template provided.
