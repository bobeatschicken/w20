Grading will be based on the following:

* Software engineering and professional development practices
* Interface design, advanced library support
* Techniques for team-oriented design and development
* Testing and test-driven development
* Software reliability and robustness
* Students present and demonstrate final projects


### Grading experiments

Whether the experiment "succeeds" or "fails" is irrelevant to your grade.
Your experiments will be graded by the following criteria:

* Hypothesis - How clearly stated is your hypothesis? Does it have an explicit, meaningful success outcome and way to measure the outcome?
* Approach - Have you defined a concrete, meaningful change in approach? Is it narrow yet interesting? If you change too many variables, it is hard to evaluate the results. But if the experiment is obvious or not a large deviation, it is hard to evaluate the result.
* Comparison to literature - describe any existing approaches that your experiment relates to. Is this something new that your team came up with? If so, how does it compare to other approaches which are popular in professional software development? If you are drawing from the materials presented in the lectures, this part becomes a lot easier! But if you choose to draw from other material for your experiment concept, your team will need to describe the content and how your idea compares to the relevant material (blog posts, articles, book chapters). Cite one or two sources.
