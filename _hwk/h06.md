For this homework, please read this brief glossary entry about unit testing and acceptance testing:

* <https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/unit-test>
* <https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/acceptance>

Then read these more detailed articles on how to write acceptance tests.  Note here that "acceptance tests" and "acceptance criteria" can be used interchangably.

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1">  (10 pts) What is at least one thing that unit tests and acceptance tests have in common?  

Answer as if you were at a job interview.  For full credit, give an answer that reflects deep understanding (and would help you get the job) rather than one that is "technically correct" but reflects only shallow understanding, or no understanding.  An example of the kind of answer that I do not want is: "both of them have the word *test* in the name".  That is certainly true, but shows no understanding.

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1">  (10 pts) What is the essential difference between unit testing and acceptance testing?

Again, answer as if you were at a job interview.  For full credit, give an answer that reflects deep understanding (and would help you get the job) rather than one that is "technically correct" but reflects only shallow understanding, or no understanding.  An example of the kind of answer that I do not want is: "both of them have the word *test* in the name".  That is certainly true, but shows no understanding.

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" markdown="1">  Choose an existing user story from the application your team is writing for CS48.  You are going to produce an acceptance test for that user story.

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1" > (10 pts) Remind us of the 1-sentence description of your product.

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Write the user story you have chosen (in the form of as a/an x I can y so that z)
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Using the GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format illustratd in <http://bit.ly/cs48-w19-h06-article>,
  write one acceptance test for this user story.

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" markdown="1">  Now, look at the example <http://bit.ly/cs48-w19-h06-article> again, reading about how acceptance tests are paired with a rule.     Choose either an existing user story from the application your team is writing for CS48, or come up with a new one&mdash;one that would be amenable to writing user stories in this fashion (paired user stories along with a rule.)


<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Write the user story you have chosen (in the form of as a/an x I can y so that z).  It should be a different story from the one chosen above.
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Write the rule that your pair of acceptance tests will illustrate.
  
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" markdown="1"> (20 pts) Using the GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format illustratd in <http://bit.ly/cs48-w19-h06-article>,
  write a pair of acceptance tests for this user story that goes with the rule specified.
