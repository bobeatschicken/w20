Once again, visit this web page

* <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/>

For this assignment, we will return to the these sections on that page, but this time, we WILL follow the links t
the *values*, *principles*,  *Agile Manifesto*, and *12 principles* (same target as principles).

* What is Agile?
* What is Agile Software Development?
* A Short History of Agile

Read those sections, and pages linked to by the keywords *values*, *principles*,  *Agile Manifesto*, and *12 principles*.

Then answer these questions:

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> One application that each of you has used in order to be in this class is UCSB's GOLD system, the system used to register for classes.  Give three examples of user stories, using the suggested form: As a `___` I can `___` so that `___`.

If necessary, review the reading about this recommended form so that you understand what should go in each blank.

<b>For full credit: include at least two different roles in your list, not only the role of being a student.</b>  Though you have likely only interacted with GOLD in the role of a student, imagine, also, the role that the staff in, say the CS department might have when adding courses to the schedule, giving out add codes, and other things that staff do regarding registration.

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> As the readings describe, the user story starts with "As a `___` I can `___` so that `___`", but does not end there.   The bigger picture is sometimes described this way: card, conversation, confirmation.

Briefly describe what each of these means:
