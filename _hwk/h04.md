Once again, visit this web page

* <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/>

For this assignment, we will return to  these sections on that page, but this time, we WILL follow the links to
the *values*, *principles*,  *Agile Manifesto*, and *12 principles* (same target as principles).

* What is Agile?
* What is Agile Software Development?
* A Short History of Agile

Read those sections, and pages linked to by the keywords *values*, *principles*,  *Agile Manifesto*, and *12 principles*.

Then answer these questions:

(Answer as if you were asked this question in an interview for an internship or job at a software company.)

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (15 pts) What are three examples of Agile methodologies?  You can just name them; you don't have to explain each in detail.

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) What makes these (the answers to your previous question) methodologies rather than part of the Agile Mindset?
