Read the material at the following web page. It's relatively short.  
For the assignment, just this page&mdash;you don't need to follow each link (I'll let you know which links you need to follow and read below.)

* <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/>

You should read these sections on that page.  For this assignment, you do not need to follow the links to the values, 
twelve principles, or the Agile Manifesto.

* What is Agile?
* What is Agile Software Development?
* A Short History of Agile

Also read the brief definitions of the seven key Agile concepts listed, and follow and read the material linked for
each of these seven.  Each is brief:
* User Stories
* Daily Meeting (a.k.a. Standup, Scrum)
* Incremental Development
* Iterative Development
* Team
* Milestone Retrospective
* Personas

Then answer these questions:

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (20 pts) In your own words, in the context of Agile software development, what is a "User Story"?

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> One application that each of you has used in order to be in this class is UCSB's GOLD system, the system used to register for classes.  Give three examples of user stories, using the suggested form: As a `___` I can `___` so that `___`.

If necessary, review the reading about this recommended form so that you understand what should go in each blank.

<b>For full credit: include at least two different roles in your list, not only the role of being a student.</b>  Though you have likely only interacted with GOLD in the role of a student, imagine, also, the role that the staff in, say the CS department might have when adding courses to the schedule, giving out add codes, and other things that staff do regarding registration.

(5 pts) First user story:

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Second user story:

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Third user story:
</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> As the readings describe, the user story starts with "As a `___` I can `___` so that `___`", but does not end there.   The bigger picture is sometimes described this way: card, conversation, confirmation.

Briefly describe what each of these means:

(5 pts) Card:

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Conversation:
