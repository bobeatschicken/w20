# Demo 



<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> during two <i>mandatory meetings</i>, all groups in turn will
present demonstrations of their final project systems. Grading for this assignment will focus
on the effectiveness of the demonstrations, not the projects per se.
Other groups' members <i>will</i> attend, and are expected to ask questions and provide helpful
comments.</p>
<p>Visitors are welcome too. The CS Department even recorded videos of some past presentations.</p>

<h3>Instructions for presenters - on the day of your group's demonstration:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrations will take place in the usual lecture room.</li>
<li>The task is to briefly, but completely show the class what your system does.
   <table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4><tr><td>
   If the nature of your system prevents you from running it in the lecture room in such
   a way that it can be displayed by the projector - either using the lectern PC or by
   plugging in your laptop - then you must find another way to demonstrate it for the
   entire class to see. Holding up a phone, tablet or laptop is not good enough! Creating a video
   of the program running is okay, for example, or preparing a Powerpoint presentation with
   screenshots of the running program is another possible solution.
   </td></tr></table></li>
<li>No need for a group presentation - if one member can adequately demonstrate
   the system, that is okay. All group members should attend though, to lend
   support and to witness the demonstrations of other groups.</li>
<li>All group members also should be prepared to
   answer questions from the instructor and/or TA about how to interact with your system.</li>
<li>Presentations/demos should be between 7 and 8 minutes (they will be timed and you will be graded on hitting this duration, so make sure and practice).
</ul>

<h3>Instructions for participation by non-presenters - the other day:</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>All students are expected to attend all demonstrations,</i> even on your group's
    "off" day.</li>
<li>Also please remember it is rude to arrive late or leave early, and act accordingly.
    A roll call may be taken at any time (even more than once) during a session. If you are
    absent, then we will subtract from your personal portion of the Demonstration score.</li>
<li>We encourage your comments and/or questions for the presenters too.</li>
</ul>
