# Progress Report Instructions
   
A Progress Report includes <em>both</em> a brief presentation to the
   class, <em>and</em> a
   completed <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf94OwYzxjIYyx3mbpO_Z46WmtkTJdcY1zrFbmbrLzj_sJjVw/viewform?usp=sf_link">Progress
  Report form</a>.

The presentations will take place during lecture periods, and the
associated forms must be turned by the indicated deadline (TODO: fill this in) on the
dates of these presentations.   The turn is done via making a commit
to the appropriate `.md` file in your teams `PROGRESS_Tnn` repo before
the deadline.

If you have done this correctly, the appropriate link
on the [Teams Page]({{ '/teams_page/' | relative_url }}) will link to the report,
provided you are logged into an account with access to the report.

# Schedule

The progress reports are indicated as progress01, progress02, etc. in the table
below, with the due dates as shown:

{%- include progress_reports.html -%}



# Individual Participation Rule

* **Each group member must present *at least one* Progress Report to the
class during the quarter**

* No member may present more than two of these reports.

To help us record your compliance with this rule, we require that the
person who presents a report is also the person responsible for completing
the online form that corresponds with that report, and the report include
a record of who presented, and how many others times that individual presented.
   
To clarify: it is okay (even encouraged) to prepare the Progress Reports together as
a group. It is also okay if one or more group members assists the main speaker during the actual
presentations. But it is mandatory that each group member is the main speaker for
at least one presentation - and thus turns in at least one report form - over the
course of the quarter.

Compliance with this rule will be monitored, and points will be subtracted from the
group's project score if it is not honored. Again to clarify: the entire group's score will
be reduced, not just the affected members' scores.

# Filling in the Form

Do not skip any of the identity boxes at the top of the form:

*  <u>Complete email address</u> - to which a copy of the report should be sent, and from
   which an email to the instructor will be sent. Be sure it is complete and correct!
   
* <u>Your name</u> - means the name of the lead person for that week's report; this should
   be the same person who presented in class that day and who also is the person filling out
   the form.
   
*  <u>Group ID</u> - important to insure proper recording of grades. Please select
   it carefully. These ID assignments will be announced
   as soon as possible, hopefully well before you fill out your first Progress Report.
   
* <u>Report number</u> - also important for grade recording. Refer to the schedule above
  to know the number associated with the report you are currently completing, and select
  that number from the available choices.

The report should be formatted in Markdown.

1. <u>Group Accomplishments</u> - just "since the last report" please!

   Of course the first report has no precedent, so be sure to
   read those special instructions at the link in the above schedule. Similarly, more
   special instructions links will be added to the schedule for some future reports - so be
   sure to check for those in upcoming weeks.

   Normally we expect this section to mostly consist of a list of items moved from
   a prior report's to-do list. We also anticipate that you will often have progress
   to report that wasn't even included in a prior to-do list, as well as partial progress
   on some of the items still left to finish. Please keep the text of this section brief,
   but try to be complete in its major points.
   
2. <u>Group TODOs</u> - here you will show us you have a workable plan to complete the next
   deliverable on time. To wit:

   * The Requirements Analysis is the next deliverable for report numbers 1 and 2.
   * The Draft Project is the next deliverable for reports 3, 4 and 5.
   * For reports 6, 7 and 8, the next deliverable is the Final Project (with some
     consideration given to the System Demonstration too).

   Also tell us about scheduling and personnel-assignment plans if you have them. In
   general, this is a good weekly opportunity to make sure your group is on track.
   
3. <u>Problems</u> - both technical and teamwork problems should be noted, but only
   if your group is really struggling with them. In fact you should expect to encounter
   hundreds(?) of small and mid-sized problems in working on the project, but don't
   share them all - just the ones impeding your progress.
   
4. <u>Comments</u> - anything else you want to tell us.


Late Report Policies

Of course our preference is that you will submit your
written reports before the 5:00 pm deadlines, and doing so will earn you the full credit
that your report merits.

Any late report turned in within 24 hours of its original date/time due is eligible for 
partial credit as follows:
* 1st late report - subtract 20 percent
* 2nd late report - subtract 40 percent
* 3rd and subsequent times - subtract 80 percent.

No credit is awarded for any report turned in more than 24 hours late.

# Presenting the Report in Class

Basically, the presentation should summarize the information you plan to include in
the form. The key word in that sentence is *summarize*. There is no time to
present all of the details in a 3-5 minute presentation. Some consideration should be
given to making it interesting (or even entertaining) for the class too - so highlight
the most compelling parts of your progress report.

The time limits are critical: no less than 3 minutes and no more than 5 minutes is
acceptable. Practice your presentation before saying it in class, to be sure it is sharp
and fits into the allowable time limits. Stopping to ask the instructor, "Is that enough?"
is not the right way to do it - instead *know* when enough is covered by preparing
ahead of time.

The file <a href={{ "/projects/OralReport.pdf" | relative_url }}>OralReport.pdf</a> is a good outline to follow for your oral report.
