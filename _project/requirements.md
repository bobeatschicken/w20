<p>First, read about requirements analysis and related artifacts.

      will cover this reading too)</dt>
      <dd>Craig Larman, Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of <em>Applying UML and Patterns: An
      Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, and the Unified Process.
      2nd Edition.</em></dd>
      <dd>Also read <em>Code Complete</em> (textbook), Chapters 1, 2 and 3 (at least through section 3.4).</dd>
      <dt>Recommended reading:</dt>
      <dd>Laurie Williams, <a href="UseCaseRequirements.pdf">"Use Case-based Requirements."</a>
      Online chapter.</dd>
<dd>
Dan North's <a href="support/DanNorth-Stories.pdf">overview of using User Stories for SW design</a>
</dd><dd>Mike Cohn's <a href="support/User-Stories-Applied-Mike-Cohn.pdf">chapter from User Stories Applied</a>
</dd><dd>Agile Modeling's <a href="support/AgileModeling-Stories.pdf">article on writing good User Stories</a>

<li><b>Update the project description</b> you prepared for Progress Report 1 to
    make sure this description is <em>still</em> an informative introduction to your proposed project.</li>
<li><b>Prepare a Vision</b> (Larman chapter 7), including at least the following sections:
    <ul>
    <li>Problem statement
    <li>Key high-level goals and user goals (okay to combine to one section)
    <li>System features
    <li>Other requirements and constraints (enhanced, with details that might appear in the "Supplementary
        Specification" of a more elaborate project).
    </ul></li>
<li><b>Identify, and write use cases</b> (Larman chapter 6) for the proposed system.
       Use an "essential UI-free style" (section 6.11) and include at least the following sections:
    <ul>
    <li>Name of use case
    <li>Primary actor
    <li>Main success scenario (basic flow)
    <li>Extensions (alternative flows)
    </ul>
    Use case diagrams are not required, but would be helpful if there are many use cases and/or
    important relations between use cases.<br />User stories <a href="../slides/userstories.pdf">in this form (including acceptance tests)</a> can be used instead of use cases if you prefer.</li>
<li><b>Prepare a schedule</b> for implementing the use cases over at least two development iterations.
    Say which use cases will be fully implemented in the first iteration. If your intention is to
    implement simplified versions of any of the use cases in iteration 1 (and complete
    them in a later iteration), describe the simplified use cases.</li>
<li><b>Begin a glossary</b> (Larman sections 7.6 and 7.7).</li>
<li><b>Assemble a complete requirements analysis document</b>. All text must be typewritten
    (but hand-drawn diagrams are acceptable). The document must be 
    contained in a <em>single PDF file</em>, assembled in the following order:
    <ol type=a>
    <li>Cover page with Group ID code, project title, and each of your names.</li>
    <li>Project description</li>
    <li>Vision</li>
    <li>Use cases or User stories</li>
    <li>Project schedule</li>
    <li>Glossary</li>
    </ol></li>
<li>
	Turn in the PDF via Piazza as described in an earlier Piazza post.<br>
    Officially, it is due Friday, Feb 2 by 5:00pm. Credit may be reduced up to 30 percent
    per day for late submissions.</li>
