# Progress Report 8

In addition to the usual topics (recent progress, to-do items,
problems and relevant comments), also please <em>tell us your plans for the
<a href="demo.html">demonstration</a></em>.
Will you be able to run the program while we watch it on the projection screen? If not,
then what are your substitute plans to allow the whole class (at once) to see your
running system?

Add a note about these plans to the "Comments" section of your written report.

There will be *no oral reports this week*. Any group who turns in their written
Progress Report #6 as usual will receive an extra 50 points for the oral
presentation part. :smile:
