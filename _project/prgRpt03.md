Progress Report 3

# Oral report

Present one of your (most interesting) use cases this week. It is particularly entertaining when
a classmate helps you present the use case. One speaker represents the
system - remember just one, because the system is a black box at this stage -
and the other speaker can represent the primary actor (i.e., user). It is okay if you want
to just say it by yourself too.

Be sure to tell us your recent progress, to-do items and problems as well.
   
# Written report

Do not include the use case description in your written report. We can
read that and much more in your Requirements Analysis document.
Just tell us your progress, to-do items, and problems as usual.
