# Final Project Instructions


For this assignment you must complete at least one more full development iteration
that results in a <b>significant increment (and improvement) over the system turned
	in for the Draft Project</b>. Additionally, you must update the documentation you produced
for that Draft, and we expect these updates will be more complete and more sophisticated than
your first attempts.


<h3>Work scope</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>Plan</u> precisely how much more of the system will be completed before the project
    deadline, and meet with your TA to discuss your plan.</li>
<li>Perform these activities for each additional iteration:
    <ol>
    <li><u>Synchronize</u> key analysis and design artifacts to the code
        produced for earlier iterations. <font size=-1>(Be sure to do this
        <em>after</em> the last iteration too.)</font></li>
    <li><u>Analyze and Design</u>. Create or update the following items:
        <ul type="circle">
        <li>static class and package diagrams</li>
        <li>system sequence diagrams</li>
        <li>interaction and state diagrams</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li><u>Implement and Test</u>. Make sure that any feature included in the system works
        correctly, and make sure your system is robust (look up what it means for a system
        to be "robust" if necessary).</li>
    </ol>
<li>Neatly assemble the updated documentation, and add some thoughtfully written text
    to connect the parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Altogether lots to do. [Remember to prepare the <a href="demo.html">Demonstration</a>
   too.] Work as a team to get it all done right!</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>Update all of the <a href="draft.html#files">Draft Project deliverables</a>, both
   System and Documentation parts. Refer to that assignment for detailed instructions
   not repeated below.</p>
<ul>
   <li><u>System</u> - source code, data, and README.txt, all as they are specified in the Draft
       Project instructions. For this Final Project, also please include an executable version
       as possible, so the instructor might be able to easily demonstrate it in future classes. Commit all of this in your github repo and specify the repo (or repos and branches) in your PDF.</li>
   <li><u>Documentation</u> - cover page, domain analysis and system design artifacts, and
       glossary, all as specified in the Draft Project instructions. But also please
       add sufficient text to tie the parts together - i.e., make it seem like a report
       instead of a loose collection of unrelated items.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Due Monday, Mar 19 before 5:00 pm</h3>
<p>Turn in single PDF via piazza.  TAs and instructor must be able to clone your repo(s) as part of their evaluation process.  Include instructions on how to deploy and execute your project as part of the Documentation (assuming we have access to all of the same services that you do).</p>
