Your primary responsibility as a group during the first week is to select a
project to work on for the rest of the quarter. The schedule allows no time to waste on
this task, and so we insist that you complete it by the time of the lecture on
{{ page.due | date: "%a %-d %b" }}

Remember the general Progress Report instructions: one person in your group must take
the lead in presenting your report to the class that day. This person may do the presentation
alone, or if necessary it is okay for other members to assist. Additionally <em>this lead person
must be the one to fill out and submit the Progress Report form before 
{{ page.prgRptDue | date: "%I:%M%P" }} on {{ page.prgRptDue | date: "%a %-d %b" }}. 

In responding to the question (What accomplished...), you <em>must </em>include all of
the following items:

* Your group's <u>Project Title</u>. Yes, you need to decide that now.</li>
* The name of the one member of your group who is being designated
  as the <u>point of contact</u> for future group correspondence by the TA and instructor.</li>
* A brief <u>project description</u>, as it might be written by a client.</li>
* The github URL of your project (<a href="http://eci.ucsb.edu/eci/services/github/">UCSB</a> or
   <a href="http://www.github.com">Git</a>).

You may choose to make your repo private. However, it should be
created under the course organization, {{site.course_github_org}} or
so that the instructional staff have access.

We will monitor your progress via your commits to this repo,
so let us know if it changes.

If you have additional progress to report, you can include that in the answer to
the To-Do question.  Our expectations for this first project report will be modest, as
we are only getting started. In future weeks, our expectations will be a bit higher.

One final reminder from the general instructions: practice your presentation to ensure
it will be completed in the allowed 3-5 minutes.
