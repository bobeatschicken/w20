bio: >
   My name is Wei Tung. I'm currently a third year computer science major. I have done numerous mobile (Android)
   and website application projects and internships over the past few years. I have not decided what topic I'll
   focus on in the future but currently I enjoy writing applications, analyzing data, and a little bit of machine
   learning. Besides programming, I like to listen to music, play console games, and eat.
