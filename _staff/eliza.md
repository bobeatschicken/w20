bio: >
    I'm Eliza, a 4th year Computer Science Major looking forward to graduating this Spring. I originally entered UCSB as a CCS Art Major, but was drawn to the logical and detailed nature of CS during my freshman year. Gradually, I became more comfortable coding and officially switched majors late sophomore year. I understand what it's like to feel intimidated by unfamiliar concepts, so I'd like to help my fellow peers any way I best can. CS56 was my favorite lower-division course because I learned more about real-world programming practices. My areas of interest in CS include autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and UI/UX design. During my previous internship, I rode in one of Waymo's cars, designed the UI for an online educational service, and helped create a marketing plan to promote the service. I'd love to talk about any of these topics if you have questions or just want to chat!
