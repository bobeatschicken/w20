bio: >
     I'm a first year PhD student in the Programming Languages lab.  Before coming to UCSB, I worked at a startup that designed robotic arms, Righthand Robotics, in Boston, MA.  I am currently interested in mathematical models of concurrent and parallel programming systems.
     I spend my spare time trying to find Mech-E students to coerce into helping me build a coffee roaster.
