UC Santa Barbara is an accredited US University, accredited through the normal process for accrediting higher education programs in the United States [(wikipedia article)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States).
In addition, the degree programs in the College of Engineering currently pursue a additional supplementary accreditation
known as ABET.  Not all B.S. programs in Computer Science at US universities pursue this additional accreditation, though many do.

One requirement for ABET accreditation is that students can 
*"Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles"*.

Accordingly, in one homework assignment you'll be asked to read the Code of Ethics of the **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)** which according to its website, is "the world's largest educational and scientific computing society".
