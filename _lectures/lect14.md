* Presentations are 10 minutes each on day 1, with 3 minute for questions and 2 minutes for transition. 
* We should be able to fit in five presentations.

# How these teams were chosen

<s>Teams that are ready and volunteer to present on this day will be placed into a lottery.   We'll draw names for who presents first.</s>

<s>Each team that is drawn will do their presentation immediately, and all team members in good standing with their team will receive 1 pt of extra credit on their *final course grade*.</s>

<s>If there are more teams than time available for presentations, only the names drawn (i.e. the ones that actually present) will get the extra credit.</s>

* Presentations are 10 minutes each on day 1, with 3 minute for questions and 2 minutes for transition. 
* We should be able to fit in five presentations.
