# Original Protocol

(set aside after class discussion.  See [Lect 14]({{ '/lectures/lect14' | relative_url }}) for explanation of how this protocol was modified based on input from Prof. Kharitonova and the class.)

<s>All teams should be ready to present by this day.</s>

* <s>We'll take volunteers first.   Unlike in the previous lecture meeting, there is no extra credit boost for being ready this day.</s>
* <s>After that we'll draw lots for presentation order.  If a team is not ready to present, all members of that team are docked 2 pts on their course grade (a penalty on top of all other grade calculations), and will be required to do their presentation the following class.</s>
