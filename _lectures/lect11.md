Guest lecture by three senior staff from [Procore](https://www.procore.com/jobs).

Procore is a software development company in Carpinteria (30 minutes drive south of the UCSB campus) that serves the construction industy.

# Topics 

* Amir and Jason will discuss QA in general, and acceptance testing for issues/user stories in particular
   * I'm also hopeful they might talk about testing and code review processes at Procore
   * Their talk will, in part, be based on Chapter 8 of the book [*Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams*](https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/topics/testing_agile_testing_crispin_and_gregory/) by  Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory (Addison-Wesley 2009).
   * The Crispin and Gregory book is used bythe Quality Assurance staff at Procore as a reference.

* Heidi and I will have a brief Q&A conversation about Agile/Scrum/Lean/Kanban and the importance of Teamwork skills
* If time permits, we'll also incorporate time for a brief standup; please make that standup very efficient on time so we maximize our time with Amir, Jason and Heidi.
