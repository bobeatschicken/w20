# Topics 

* Amir and Jason will discuss QA in general, and acceptance testing for issues/user stories in particular
   * I'm also hopeful they might talk about testing and code review processes at Procore
* Heidi and I will have a brief Q&A conversation about Agile/Scrum/Lean/Kanban and the importance of Teamwork skills
* We'll also incorporate time for a brief standup; please make that standup very efficient on time so we maximize our time with Amir, Jason and Heidi.
