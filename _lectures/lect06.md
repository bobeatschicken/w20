# Review of last time

Guest Presenter: Kate Kharitonova

* <https://github.com/TEAM-repo/TEAM-repo/blob/master/sample_README.md>

Some clarifications:

* The "Gems" section should really be "dependencies".
   * What programming languages and frameworks are you using?
   * "Gems" is a Ruby specific way of saying this.
   * Remove "Gems" if you aren't using Ruby, and replace it with Dependencies

* Make things like [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), etc. hyperlinks to those frameworks, not just words.

* The README.md is a developer facing document, not a user facing document.

   * "What do you need to install? Nothing! Just use a web browser"
      * FALSE.  That' may be true for the end user.
      * But if you are developer, you need at least the toolchain
         for your language and framework.

* There shouldn't be any "TODO" stuff in your document as delivered.

(I'll be adding a rubric for these README.md's into a future lab.)

# Going over lab03, lab04, lab05, etc.
