# Announcements:

## Retro survey: last reminder
* REMINDER: The retro survey is worth a big part of your lab grade and your team's lab grade.
* You need to have it filled out no later than 3:30pm Thursday.
* The link is here: <http://bit.ly/ucsb-cs48-w19-retro1>
* Ask your team during your standup---did you fill it out?
* Anyone not present at class today, ask them: did they fill it out?

## CONFIRMED: next Wednesday, guest lecture by three senior staff from Procore

* Heidi Helfland, *Director, Engineering Excellence*

* Jason Wojciechowski, *Lead QA Engineer*

Topics for Wed 02/20:
* Amir and Jason will discuss QA in general, and acceptance testing for issues/user stories in particular
   * I'm also hopeful they might talk about testing and code review processes at Procore
* Heidi and I will have a brief Q&A conversation about Agile/Scrum/Lean/Kanban and the importance of Teamwork skills
* We'll also incorporate time for a brief standup; please make that standup very efficient on time so we maximize our time with Amir, Jason and Heidi.
