Project Presentations, Part 2 of 3

All teams should be ready to present by this day.   

* We'll take volunteers first.   Unlike in the previous lecture meeting, there is no extra credit boost for being ready this day.
* After that we'll draw lots for presentation order.  If a team is not ready to present, all members of that team are docked 2 pts on their course grade (a penalty on top of all other grade calculations), and will be required to do their presentation the following class.

* Presentations are 6 minutes each on day 1, with 2 minute for questions and 2 minutes for transition. 
* We should be able to fit in five presentations plus doing the TA evals
