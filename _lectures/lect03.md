# Check in

## [lab00 instructions]({{'/lab/lab00/' | relative_url }})

* Make sure that you have a `/team/NORMS.md` file, with exactly that name.
   * It really helps us a lot if you follow the naming conventions strictly, so `NORMS.md`, nor `Norms.md` or `norms.md`
   * Reason: We can write a script that will iterate over all the repos and give us a link to each of your `NORMS.md` files.
   * That helps us get through the assessment part (a necessary evil of higher ed) much more efficiently.
* Make sure that  each of your `name.md` files is actually down under `./team/` and not in the root directory of the repo
   * Reason: the root directory of the repo is going to get really crowded with other things
   * Reason: it helps us to have the files in the place we expect to find them (see assessment piece above.)
   * We aren't trying to be annoying or create busy work.  We are trying to
      * help you learn to structure things according to convention
      * lead you through a set of exercises to increase the chances that you'll build a successful team

* Also: 
   * Start working in a NEW branch, such as `chris-helloworld`, `taylor-joey-helloworld` etc. on the Hello World for your app.
   * Put it RIGHT in the ROOT of the directory, as if the project were the whole repo.
   * Each student, as part of their individual grade for the course, will be required to be part of an individual or pair submission for this assignment.
   * When it's done, do a pull request.
   * When they are all done, the team will decide which of the hello world's it want to accept as the basis of starting the project.
   * The deadline for this is TBA, but probably a week from Friday.
