* Midterm Exam is CANCELLED.  There will only be a final exam.
* Today:
   * Pick up {% include hwk hwk='h09' %} and get a bit of explanation
   * Do standup
   * Then testing
* Thursday:
   * Sprint Planning XOR Retro XOR Time to work on your project
   * XOR: Exclusive or.  There isn't enough time to do more than one of those.
   
For the testing presentation:

* I'd like to ask the testing coordinator from each group, plus one extra person from each group to stay for that.
* Identify who that should be during standup.
* The rest of you:
    * May stay and work quietly (use chat rather than talking out loud to communicate), OR
    * May decide on a place to reconvene with your laptops and work.

Please, though, **if you go**, I'd like to strongly encourage you to **use this time for your project**
* Put a note on your team's slack channel with what you accomplished during this time.
* Please don't do retro without your testing coordinator and their pair
* You might get started on sprint planning---that's a decision you can make as a team.
