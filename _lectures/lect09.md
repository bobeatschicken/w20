# Identifying partner groups

Please write your partner group's name in the space on the white board.

# Reminder: When MVP is done, or wrapping up, think about testing

If you are the first person to run out of things to work on towards MVP, add issues for testing and assign them to yourself:

* Unit testing 
   * Python: `unittest` or `pytest` or something else?  and `coverage`
   * JS: `mocha`, `chai`, and `istanbul`?  Or something else?
   * C#: Figure it out

* Integration and End to End testing:
   * For web apps, selenium?  Others?
   * Look into frameworks for React, Node, Unity, PyGame
   
Ideally, we would have introduced this earlier, around the time of Hello World.

# Announcements

Look on the Slack <https://ucsb-cs48-w19.slack.com>.  There are some channels with potentially useful/interesting stuff:

```
#agile
#cpp
#css
#design-patterns
#feedback
#flask
#general
#java
#js
#python
#random
#style
#testing
#useful_links
```

* Consider joining the channels that pertain to the topics that your team is dealing with.  
* Contribute pointers to interesting articles
* If there are additional channels we should have (e.g. for `#html`, `#sqlalchemy`, `#react`, `#node`, `#unity` etc.) create them
* Or suggest them on `#general` if you don't have access to create them.

# Teams that haven't presented yet

* Say your name
* Say name of your project, and 1 sentence description.
* Give a demo, or describe your MVP
* Show us your Kanban board, and describe what your team is focussed on right now
