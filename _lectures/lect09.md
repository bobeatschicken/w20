# Announcements

Look on the Slack <https://ucsb-cs48-w19.slack.com>.  There are some channels with potentially useful/interesting stuff:

```
#agile
#cpp
#css
#design-patterns
#feedback
#flask
#general
#java
#js
#python
#random
#style
#testing
#useful_links
```

* Consider joining the channels that pertain to the topics that your team is dealing with.  
* Contribute pointers to interesting articles
* If there are additional channels we should have (e.g. for `#html`, `#sqlalchemy`, `#react`, `#node`, `#unity` etc.) create them
* Or suggest them on `#general` if you don't have access to create them.

# Teams that haven't presented yet

* Say your name
* Say name of your project, and 1 sentence description.
* Give a demo, or describe your MVP
* Show us your Kanban board, and describe what your team is focussed on right now
